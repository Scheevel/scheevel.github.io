title: Simple test of remote SQL connectivity!
published: true

There is a file type – UDL file – that you can simply create that will bring up a window to allow testing of remote connections to SQL.
Go anywhere on your system and create an empty text file named anything but instead of "txt" make sure the extension is UDL.  Then, double-click on the file and up pops a SQL connectivity window to allow testing of remote SQL connections.
